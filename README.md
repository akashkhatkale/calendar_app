How to use it ?
Open the app and login with your gmail id. Once logged in, please do not logout. Test all the functionalities, because after logging out, we cannot try with the same gmail id again due to access token and refresh token. This was not developed due to time constraint.

Features:
1. View your calendar events of 2024.
2. Add an event to your calendar
3. View details of calendar event.
   

The whole bandwidth was spent on figuring out Google OAuth and Calendar API, so there are some limited functionalities.
Scope of improvement:
1. Some strings are hardcoded, which can be moved to constants.
2. Sign out functionality doesnt work properly, due to time constraint.
3. Very basic UI, can be improved.
4. Due to time constraint, only added 2024 calendar.
5. The whole codebase can be modularised.
